#+TITLE: Parallel Design Patterns: Exercise 1
#+AUTHOR: Lawrence Mitchell

* Introduction

In this series of exercises, you will be exploring some of the design
patterns covered in the course.  To do this, we need some code to
start from.  The first exercise is to produce this code.

You will be implementing an algorithm which generates a picture of the
Mandelbrot set (figure \ref{fig:mandelbrot}).  There is a template
code from which you can start which includes routines for initialising
and outputting the image, however, you will have to implement the code
to compute the Mandelbrot set yourself.

** The Mandelbrot set

Consider the recursion
\begin{equation}
z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c
\label{eq:mandelbrot-recursion}
\end{equation} 
with $z_0 = 0$.  The Mandelbrot set, $M$, is the set of complex
numbers $M \subset \mathbb{C}$ such that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}|z_{n}|$ is bounded.
For example, if $c=0$ then $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}|z_{n}| = 0$ and so $c=0$ is in
the Mandelbrot set.  It turns out that we do not need to check if
$|z_n|$ escapes to infinity, $c \in M$ if and only if
$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}|z_n| \le 2$.

To compute the Mandelbrot set, rather than explicitly evaluating the
infinite limits, we use a heuristic to decide if a point is in the
set.  We limit the number of iterations to some finite value
$n_{\mathrm{max}}$.  To check if a complex number $c$ is in the set we
use the following algorithm.

1. Let $z_0 = 0$
2. If $|z_0| > 2$, $c$ is outside the set, return 0
3. Compute $z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$
   1. If $|z_{n+1}| > 2$, $c$ is outside the set, return $n+1$
   2. If $n+1 = n_{\mathrm{max}}$, $c$ is in the set, return $n_{\mathrm{max}}$
   3. Else, set $n \leftarrow n+1$ and go to 3.
      

To generate the pictures of the Mandelbrot set, we choose a region of
the complex plane and divide it up into discrete values.  For each
such value, apply the Mandelbrot recursion.  We colour each pixel by
the number of iterations it took before it was decided as bounded or
unbounded.  For example, if $|z_{15}| > 2$ then the point is coloured
with value $15$.  The provided utility code takes care of converting
this single value into a colour.

*** A brief aside on complex numbers

Fortran has built in support for complex numbers which we can use.
C didn't until C99, so in the C version of the practical, you need to
do all the complex arithmetic yourself.  Here's a quick,
non-exhaustive refresher.
Let $z = x + \mathrm{i} y$, where $\mathrm{i} = \sqrt{-1}$.  Then
\begin{equation}
 |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
 z^2 = x^2 - y^2 + \mathrm{i} (2 x y)
\end{equation} 

Although we use Fortran's built-in complex number support, you may
still need to do computations with the real and imaginary parts
separately.  You may need:
#+begin_src f90
  rpart = real(c)                 ! The real part of c
  ipart = aimag(c)                ! The imaginary part of c
  z = cmplx(rpart, ipart)         ! A new complex number
#+end_src

* Setup

You will be carrying out these exercises on =ness=, so log in and
download the tar file for the exercise (available at
[[http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/msc/courses/PDP/exercise1.tar]]) and unpack
it.  Change into the =mandelbrot= directory that has just been created.
There are two subdirectories =C= and =F= corresponding to the C and
Fortran versions of the exercise respectively.  Each subdirectory also
contains a =Makefile= that compiles the code.  The template codes
compile as is to produce a =mandelbrot= executable.  If you run this, it
will produce an output image.  Until you have implemented the code to
calculate the Mandelbrot set, this image will just be black.  To view
the image, type =display output.ppm=.

The executable accepts a number of command line arguments, which you
can see by passing the =-h= flag.
: $ ./mandelbrot -h
: Usage:
: mandelbrot [-SixXyYh]
:    -S NPIXEL    Set number of pixels in X dimension of image
:                 Y dimension is scaled to ensure pixels are square
:    -i ITS       Set max number of iterations for a point to be inside
:    -x XMIN      Set xmin coordinate
:    -X XMAX      Set xmax coordinate
:    -y YMIN      Set ymin coordinate
:    -Y YMAX      Set ymax coordinate
:    -h           Show this help
The default values show the whole Mandelbrot set.
